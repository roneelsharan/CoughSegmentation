# Cough Sound Segmentation Dataset
This page provides access to the Cough Sound Segmentation Dataset as used in [1]. The recordings in this dataset have been obtained from [here](https://zenodo.org/records/7024894). The Cough Sound Segmentation Dataset has 400 recordings of which 200 are cough recordings and 200 are non-cough recordings (refer to column 2 in the Datasheet). Additionally, the cough sounds in the 200 cough recordings have been manually segmented. The manual cough segmentation results are provided in the TXT files where the number of rows indicate the number of cough sounds in that recording, the first column gives the start time of the cough in seconds, and the second column gives the end time of the cough in seconds. The manual cough segmentation data can be used for supervised classification when developing automatic cough sound segmentation algorithms, as in [1]. The dataset has been divided into 300 recordings for training and validation and 100 recordings for testing (refer to column 3 in the Datasheet).
